## main branch

`main` for the basic functionalities of the website, and share reusable code cross projects derived from this template.

Furthermore, this branch is used for synchronizing the design system with [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com).


## dynamic-config branch

`dynamic-config` is for the dynamic configuration, especially for routes and metadata.
For example, I will use doc page to display the blog post, the route should not be named as `/docs/[slug]`,
 but `/blogs/[slug]` instead for clarity.

**add remote**

```sh
git remote add base https://github.com/asd55667/nextjs-template
```

**update when sync changes from remote**

```sh
git fetch base
```

**merge changes from remote**

```sh
git merge base/dynamic-config
```
