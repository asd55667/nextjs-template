## main branch

`main` for the basic functionalities of the website, and share reusable code cross projects derived from this template.

Furthermore, this branch is used for synchronizing the design system with [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com).


## dynamic-config branch

`dynamic-config` is for the dynamic configuration, especially for routes and metadata.
For example, I will use doc page to display the blog post, the route should not be named as `/docs/[slug]`,
 but `/blogs/[slug]` instead for clarity.
