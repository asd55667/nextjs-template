## deploy to multi platforms with SSG

To make same code deployed in these three platforms below, I have done some compat logic in `next.config.js` with environment variable.

See [detail](https://github.com/asd55667/nextjs-template/blob/main/next.config.ts)

```sh
npx tsx --tsconfig ./tsconfig.scripts.json ./src/scripts/build-registry.mts && npx next build
```

### github pages

<Callout className="mt-4">
I don't know why `src/components/icons.tsx` file broke my github workflow, just rename it and then the problem fixed.
</Callout>
